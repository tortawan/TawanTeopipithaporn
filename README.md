### Research & Project Experience

#### C++ Ant Colony Simulation (Personal Project)  
*Jan 2024 – Mar 2025*
- Architected a C++ simulation to research emergent self‑organization in swarm intelligence, modeling how simple agent rules yield complex object clustering.
- Engineered a high‑performance, multi‑agent system with OpenMP parallelization, reducing compute time by **4×** across 8 cores.
- Designed Ant agents with FIFO memory (deque) to simulate limited knowledge and adaptive movement (weighted inertia), and a Ground environment managing object distribution and ant interactions.
- Implemented dynamic pick/drop logic using linear activation (ReLU range) and efficient cluster‑size measurement via BFS.
- **Integrated OpenCV and FFmpeg to produce high‑quality simulation videos, facilitating visual debugging and stakeholder presentations.**
- **Optimized thread affinity on Windows via native API, increasing frame‑rate by ~15 % on 16‑core systems.**
- Logged simulation metrics to CSV for downstream analysis.

#### Forest‑Guided Estimation of Distributions Algorithm (RF‑MIMIC)  
*Mar 2024 – Mar 2025*
- Invented and open‑sourced **RF‑MIMIC**, a Forest‑guided Estimation of Distributions Algorithm that swaps Bayesian networks for Random Forests to model high‑order gene interactions in binary optimization.
- Demonstrated up to **2× faster convergence** and **10‑15 % higher best‑solution fitness** than canonical MIMIC and Genetic Algorithms on 100‑gene NK‑Landscape benchmarks (30 independent runs).
- Implemented robust fallback sampling and reproducibility controls, ensuring stable optimization even with sparse elite sets.
- Authored >1.8 k lines of production‑quality Python with full pytest coverage; packaged for PyPI and documented in reproducible Jupyter notebooks.
  **Technologies:** Python, scikit‑learn, NumPy, evolutionary algorithms.

#### AI Maze‑Solving Platform & Custom “No‑Turn” Heuristic   
*Mar 2025*
- Developed a Python/Pygame platform generating and visualizing mazes, comparing DFS, BFS, A*, and a novel “No‑Turn” heuristic optimizing straight‑line traversal.
- Engineered dual‑view visualization (full maze + discovered area) with panning and scrolling for agent analysis.

#### Adaptive Math Practice Desktop App  
*Oct 2024 – Mar 2025*
- Built a Python/Tkinter application offering adaptive question selection, secure user authentication (bcrypt), and performance tracking in SQLite.
- Integrated Google Gemini API for step‑by‑step explanations and LaTeX rendering via CodeCogs.

#### Reinforcement Learning for Lunar Lander  
*Jun 2019 – Sep 2019*
- Developed and tuned a DQN variant in OpenAI Gym to achieve the LunarLander winning condition in under 200 episodes.  
  **Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenAI Gym.

#### AI Slackbot for Medical Symptom Collection  
*Jan 2019 – May 2019*
- Designed “Benedict,” a Flask‑based Slackbot to gather user symptoms and provide preliminary diagnostic statistics.
